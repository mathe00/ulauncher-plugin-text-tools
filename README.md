Both extensions aim to simplify your workflow by eliminating repetitive tasks, but this **Text Tools** extension is specifically designed to be a **comprehensive** text manipulation tool.

This project is also similar to the **[Meme My Text Ulauncher Extension](https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-rnairn01-ulauncher-meme-my-text)**, which offers fun text transformations. However, **Text Tools** is more focused on practicality and covers a wider range of text formatting options for real-world tasks.
